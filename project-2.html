                <em>The future has arrived.
                    While we can't predict the future, we can inspire it. So what will our cars look like and how will
                    they function? Will we drive them or will they drive us? That seems to be the question on everyone's
                    mind. Well, we have an idea. Cars are for people who want to go to more places safely and
                    efficiently</em>

                <em>At the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Toyota is demo’ing it’s idea of the “Future of Mobility”. As has become plainly obvious over the last couple years, Toyota believes plug-in vehicles will fail and that fuel cell EV’s are the future. While other companies are at CES showing off battery based EV’s, Toyota is sticking with their fuel cells.</em>

It utilizes a single wide-screen, 3-D, full-color Head-Up Display that blends into an interior that is clean and uncluttered.</em>

Thanks to the car's advanced automated driving technologies, people with all levels of ability can enjoy the ride. You're still in charge of the car. However, through biometric sensors throughout the car, Concept-i can detect what you're feeling. That information then gets analyzed by the car's AI. That's when the automated features kick in. </p>
